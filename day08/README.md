# Day 8: GNU COBOL

I didn’t enjoy this task.

Part 1 was trivial. Part 2 was also trivial, but only on the actual input data.
I spent quite some time thinking about handling edgecases (what if there’re multiple z-nodes in the cycle?
what if cycle length isn’t uniform, because it’s not divisible by program length? what if a-nodes are in the
middle of the cycle?) before noticing that none of this actually matters because input is the simplest possible case.
I feel kinda cheated.

I chose GNU COBOL because it felt emotionally fitting.
It was an interesting experience. I think I get some part of the appeal, but I don’t want to use COBOL ever again.

The solution is formatted in the traditional style, with leftmost 7 columns empty, because that’s what
my Neovim built-in plugin understands and the last thing I want to do is to go search for a better COBOL plugin.
