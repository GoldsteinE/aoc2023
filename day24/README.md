# Day 24: Python

This day was weird. It’s trivial with SMT solver and I’m not sure how to even approach it without one.
Part 1 is also totally unrelated to part 2.

I solved it in Python because Python was the first language I used professionally and I wanted to use it on the 24th day.
It also helped that there’re Z3 bindings for Python.
