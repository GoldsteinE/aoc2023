# Day 3: VimScript

A boring language for a boring task. Honestly, I really don’t enjoy this “parse a fucked-up input and then do basic math” tasks.
Usually I try to choose a language that’s somehow relevant to the task or seems good for it, but I’m not sure there’s any language that’s good for solving these 2D parsing problems.
