# Day 16: Elixir

I initially chose Elixir because I thought that spawning each individual ray in its own process would be cool.
Unfortunately, it turned out to be *really* slow, probably because thatâ€™s a lot of processes, so I ended up only spawning initial rays in parallel.
Anyway, I got to play with actors, which is nice, and Elixir is pleasant to write in.
