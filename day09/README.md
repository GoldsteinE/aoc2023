# Day 9: POSIX Shell

I was going to solve it in BASIC (basic language for a basic task), but I couldn’t get Visual BASIC working on my machine, so I just chose another dumb language.

I’m not sure if part 2 was supposed to be harder than part 1. They were, like, exactly the same.

I chose dash as an interpreter because it’s fast.
