# Day 13: Raku

I chose Raku because it features nice utilities for working with lists & sets using fun Unicode symbols.
Rakuâ€™s list semantics turned out to be hard to get right, but the final solution is quite concise.
I also like that transposing a matrix in Raku is just `[Z] $matrix`, where `[_]` is fold and `Z` is zip.
