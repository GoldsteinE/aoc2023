# Day 7: SWI Prolog

Iâ€™ve chosen Prolog for this day because it felt like a task from Prolog textbook and I was not mistaken.
That was really easy and pleasant. The main pain was trying to debug stuff when some computation just silently hangs.
I should definitely look into logic programming some more.

My implementation is not really optimized, which makes this solution one of the slowest so far.
It has an upside of being basically a copy of the task text.
I expected I/O to be a problem, but I was able to just abuse CSV reader to do all the parsing.
