# Day 10: PHP

Tasks that require visualization are stupidly hard for me. I got help with the algorithm and I’m not even sure my implementation always works correctly. Anyways, it passes tests, so it’s good enough.

I chose PHP because it’s relatively easy to write, but still cumbersome enough so I don’t want to use it later.
