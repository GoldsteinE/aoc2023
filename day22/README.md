# Day 22: Scala

This was pretty easy. I’m not sure what the challenge of the second part was supposed to be: it added literally 5 lines to my solution.

I chose Scala because I’ve meant to try it for a long time. Unfortunately, this task didn’t exactly require Cats, so I didn’t get to play with the most fun parts,
but the basic experience was cool. Compilation times are kinda painful though.
