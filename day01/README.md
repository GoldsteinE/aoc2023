# Day 1: BQN

That was unnecessarily hard and my solution is still far from idiomatic ~pointless~ tacit BQN code.
My brain is just not wired for APL-like languages.

It’s surprisingly (relatively) fast though: I benchmarked it against two attempts from people who new BQN much better than me and it was the fastest of three.
I’ve seen a much faster solution in BQN, but it relied on weird precomputed tables stuff for string search.
